						&emsp;<strong>Shaun Xavier Pascual</strong> (born October 24, 1996) is a BS-IS student from the De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde. Shaun, an only child, was born in Navotas, Philippines where he spent most of his childhood. After he graduated high school from St. James Academy in Malabon, he went straight to De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde. He started majoring in Game Design and Development, but after a year in the program he realized that he does not have passion for games and shifted to Information Systems. Some of his interests include playing basketball, watching films, and cooking. 
					</p>
					<p>
						&emsp;Shaun enjoyed playing basketball as a young lad, so much that it made him carry the name of his high school and play against other schools. His favorite player is Kobe Bryant, he patterns his playing style to that of Kobe’s making him a prolific scorer in his prime in high school. Most of his favorite shoes are a signature of Kobe.
					</p>
					<p>
						&emsp;Shaun’s personality can be deduced by the films of various genre which he enjoys watching. His favorite films of all time are: Inception, Space Jam, Spiderman Trilogy, The Prestige, and Insidious. Inception is mainly about the mystery of dreams and whether or not we can occupy another human’s dream. Space Jam explores the world of Michael Jordan aiding a terrorized group of cartoon characters. Spiderman Trilogy focuses on Peter Parker (an average joe) acquiring special abilities, he uses it to protect the good people of his city. The Prestige is about two magicians fighting over admiration and status, they use magic to earn other people’s respect; the twist is something out of the extraordinary.
					</p>
					<p>
						&emsp;His plans after graduation include studying culinary while practicing his IS degree, he hopes to one day be a renowned chef and open up his own restaurant. He strongly expresses his love and passion for Information Systems as a profession. But his love for cooking made up his mind that running a restaurant is what he wants to do for the rest of his life.
